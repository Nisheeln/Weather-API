# Weather-API
The Weather Display App is a responsive web application built with React.js and Material-UI that provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for any city's current weather and view details such as temperature, humidity, "feels-like" temperature, and weather descriptions. Dynamic icons adapt to weather conditions like rain, heat, or cold, enhancing the user experience. The app includes error handling, displaying a message for invalid city inputs, and features a modern, gradient-based design. It is easy to set up and run locally, requiring an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Future enhancements include geolocation support and temperature unit switching.
